## Neural Autonomous Navigation with Riemannian Motion Policy 

This code implements a local reactive controller using RMP. RMP is a joint representation of environmental geometry and
robot dynamics. It produces complex local reactive behaviors that allows a robot to robustly navigate with the presence
of obstacles. We also show that an image-based RMP controller can be learned with a neural network.

## Dependencies

This code has been tested under Ubuntu 16.04.

#### python

python3 is required. This code is developed with python3.6 in an Anaconda environment.

#### pybind11

To improve efficiency, part of our code is written in C++. pybind11 is a tool to create python 
bindings of C++ code.

#### gibson

We use a modified version of gibson (mainly to speed things up). Since the compilation of gibson can
be a daunting task, we provide a precompiled version that you can download directly from
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iCjMLjBsL9_fSRC8qVAsj0BoKzPm8gHy/view?usp=sharing).

The archive contains only the license-free environments. If you want to train with more diverse
environments you need to contact the gibson authors to obtain additional environments.

#### range_libc

This library is used for fast raycasting (simulating a laser scanner). A copy is provided
under `third_party` if you clone with `--recursive`. Please follow the instructions provided
by the library to install its python binding into your chosen python environment.

## Preparation

Clone the repository and `cd` to the project directory.  
  ```
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/xymeng/rmp_nav.git
  ```

Set up environment variables:
  ```
  source set_envs.sh
  ```

Install requirements: 
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` 

Additional requirements that you may already have: 

- `pytorch` and `torchvision`. You may install via pip: `pip install torch torchvision`

- `opencv` You may install via pip: `pip install opencv-python` 

- `wxPython` You could install it via pip, but you may get compilation errors. There may exist a
prebuilt [pip wheel](https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/index.html) for your system.

Build and install `range_libc`. You may skip this step if you already have it
installed:

```
bash tools/build_rangelibc.sh
```

Build python bindings of C++ code:
  ```
  bash tools/compile_python_cpp_libs.sh
  ```

Extract the provided gibson archive:
```
tar xf gibson.tar.gz -C "${RMP_NAV_ROOT}/rmp_nav" --strip-components=1 gibson/gibson
```

Extract the [provided models archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19DrwK2CdMZRSU7hKAk2Y9s6nVWXhktW3/view?usp=sharing):
```
tar xf models.tar.gz -C "${RMP_NAV_ROOT}"
```

## Running the simulator

Set up environment variables:
```
source set_envs.sh
```

Run the simulation GUI:
```
python tools/run_sim.py --scene_id=space2
```

You should see the simulation window appearing on the screen. As the first test, press the "Start"
button on the top right corner. You should see a car running.

### Running a neural agent

We provide an example neural agent ```gibson12v2_240fov_minirccar_z0228_fisheye64_metric```. This 
agent is able to avoid obstacles reactively with a monocular RGB camera. Since it requires images
as input, we need to launch the corresponding gibson environment first:
```
cd tools
python launch_sim_server_load_balancer_multi.py gibson_space2_gpu0_128.yaml 5000
```

```gibson_space2_gpu0_128.yaml``` contains configurations of which gibson environments to launch.
Here we launch the ```space2``` environment, which corresponds to ```--scene_id=space2``` when we
launch the GUI.
 
Tip: ```launch_sim_server_load_balancer_multi.py``` can launch multiple environments simultaneously
and load-balance between them. Take a look at ```gibson_2envs_gpu01_128.yaml``` and modify from
there.

After the simulator has launched, press the "Start" button. You should see a car running. On the 
left side it will show the live image stream.

## Simulation options

#### Start and goal location

You may press the "Set start" button and then click on the map to set the start location. The 
coordinates of the location will be reflected in the text box next to the button. Alternatively you
may directly type the coordinate "x, y" in the text box. Same thing applies to setting the goal
location.

#### Initial heading

You may type in the text box to specify the initial heading of an agent (in degrees).

#### Max steps

If an agent has not reached the goal after this number of steps, simulation will terminate.

#### Step size

Time granularity for simulation. Usually you don't have to change this.

#### Agents

The simulator can run multiple agents simultaneously, which is useful for tuning. To enable an
agent, check the corresponding checkbox. Additional parameters of an agent can be specified by
pressing the "..." button on the left side. These parameters are passed into agent's constructors as
```kwargs```.

## Add your own agent

The simulator supports user-defined agents with arbitrary 2D geometry and dynamics. ```agents.py```
contains example agent definitions.

Take a look at ```rmp_nav/simulation/agent_factory_minirccar.py``` 
and ```rmp_nav/simulation/agent_factory_rccar.py``` as examples of how
to register an agent. Registered agents automatically appear in the simulator. To hide an agent,
either comment out the code or name the constructor with "_" as the first character.
